## Abstract
Design and implementation of wired and wireless communication between two embedded systems. Rough steps to be followed are setting up the hardware and implementation of LISA to send and receive payload, Improving the process by implementing scrambling and descrambling.

The main goal is to be able to implement a reliable cost effective and higher performance communication using LoRa 1276 module connected to the LPC1769, and improve the performance on changing the parameter like Spreading factor [SF], transmission power, frequency hopping etc, in real time.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are listed as follows:
1. Building an Embedded system which can perform communication.
2. Implement LISA algorithm in C programming.
3. Establish a wired communication between two platforms (Ni and Nj)
4. Establish a wireless communication between two platforms (Ni and Nj) using RF module.
5. Establish a wireless communication between two platforms (Ni and Nj) using LoRa module.
6. Improve the performance of the communication and increase the received signal strength indication
